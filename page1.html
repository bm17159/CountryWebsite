                <p> Construction of the Titanic commenced in 1909 in Belfast,
                    Ireland, by the ship-building company Harland & Wolff. Titanic was one of three ships built by Harland & Wolff and the British shipping company White Star Line. Shipbuilders worked tirelessly for two years to create the mammoth structure that was to become the Titanic, and eight workers died during its construction. After the ship was finished in 1912,
                    the Titanic was set for its maiden voyage in early April.
